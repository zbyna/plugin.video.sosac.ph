- Added user scans feature:
  - **Settings / Library service / Check subscriptions**
  
  - **Context Menu / Subscription Manager / Check subscriptions**

- added **memory cache implementation** for time and demanding operations

- Added add-on settings
    - **Tab General - to force English names**,
      1. **Sort by - czech, english, os**
          - if there is no selected location in the operating system, the default is selected,
this is a problem, for example, in LibreElec or OpenElec, where the cs_CZ.utf8 location is not available, but it comes to better times: https://forum.libreelec.tv/thread-7356.html
          - according to the standard, the Czech sorting is first alphabetical up to the letters, for me the surprise ðŸ™‚, windows it does not solve it at all, but in Linux if localization is installed, everything works according to the standard

      2. **Show 'CH' in Movies & Serials**
          - Plays them in the Movies & Serial list
        
    - **Tab Cache - Flush Cache**,
    
    - **Tab Library service - subscription and addition to the library**
      - to set the options for simultaneous execution of these items

- added **Buggalo** add-on support for optional error message sending, after user reconciliation, to sosac.comli.com
- added option **setting the plugin library to any source directly from Kodi**,
  (after restoring the default values â€‹â€‹(special: // ...) you need to restart the sock)
